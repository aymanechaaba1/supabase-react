# Chat App with Supabase and React

I tried to implement this in react, I used React Query for fetching and mutating messages.

I disabled caching because it shows the previous messages when you switch between different chat rooms.

You can Join any Chat Room, each one is related to a certain topic.

## Tools & Techniques Used:

‚ö°Ô∏è React Query for data fetching
‚ö°Ô∏è Supabase Auth for authentication
‚ö°Ô∏è Provider pattern for Authentication
‚ö°Ô∏è TailwindCSS for styling
